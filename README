NAME
    Geo::Gosmore - Interface to the headless gosmore(1)

SYNOPSIS
    First install gosmore(1), e.g. on Debian:

        sudo aptitude install gosmore

    Then build a gosmore.pak file:

        wget http://download.geofabrik.de/osm/europe/british_isles.osm.bz2
        # pv(1) is not needed, it just shows you the import progress
        bzcat british_isles.osm.bz2 | pv | gosmore rebuild

    Then use this library, with $gosmore_pak being the full path to your new
    gosmore.pak.

        my $gosmore = Geo::Gosmore->new(
            gosmore_pak => $gosmore_pak,
        );

        my $query = Geo::Gosmore::Query->new(
            flat => '51.5425',
            flon => '-0.111',
            tlat => '51.5614',
            tlon => '-0.0466',
            fast => 1,
            v    => 'motorcar',
        );

        # Returns false if we can't find a route
        my $route = $gosmore->find_route($query);
        my $distance = $route->distance;

DESCRIPTION
    Provides an interface to the headless version of the gosmore
    <http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Gosmore> routing library. When
    compiled with headless support it provides a simple interface to do
    routing. This library just parses its simple output and provides
    accessors for it.

    This is experimental software with an API subject to change.
